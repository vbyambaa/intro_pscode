Sst:
        current position (cur_pos) -where customer currently is. 
        target position (tar_pos)  -where customer want to go. 
        cur_pos cordinate (curX, curY) -cordinated by X, Y 
        tar_pos cordinate (tarX, tarY) -cordinated by X, Y 
        direction ("N", "S", "E", "W") -customer movement

Loop:
The WHILE loop continues until customer current position (cur_pos) 
matches the target position (tar_pos).

Inside the loop:
Program prompt the user to input a direction (North, South, East, or West).
Depending on the input, program adjust the current position:
If the input is “N,” , step up the y coordinate of cur_pos.
If the input is “S,” , step down the y coordinate of cur_pos.
If the input is “E,” , step up the x coordinate of cur_pos.
If the input is “W,” , step down the x coordinate of cur_pos.

End loop:
Once the loop exits  cur_pos equals tar_pos, print “You’ve made it!” 
# ------------------------------------------------ #

Code:
BEGIN
    SET cur_pos TO (curX, curY)
    SET tar_pos TO (tarX, tarY)

    WHILE cur_pos != tar_pos DO
        PRINT "Move (N, S, E, W):"
        INPUT direction

        IF direction = "N" THEN
            INCREMENT cur_pos.y
        ELSE IF direction = "S" THEN
            DECREMENT cur_pos.y
        ELSE IF direction = "E" THEN
            INCREMENT cur_pos.x
        ELSE IF direction = "W" THEN
            DECREMENT cur_pos.x
    END WHILE

    PRINT "You've made it!"
END
